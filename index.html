    <h2>Evgeny Starostin</h2>
    <p>
        I want to develop in the field of programming. I have a basic level of proficiency in JavaScript. I have experience in development: at VTB Bank, I wrote and developed scripts for a voice bot. I am skilled at and enjoy working in teams; my calm demeanor allows me to effectively handle complex situations. I approach assigned tasks responsibly and always strive to deliver results. I do not have any harmful habits.
